# Python Programs for SECOND Semester
This repository contains the Python programs that I have submitted for assignments and records during my second semester at college. The programs cover a range of topics, including basic data types, control structures, arrays, functions, and file handling.

## Structure of the Repository
* The repository is organized into two folders: one for lab assignments and one for records. Each folder contains several Python programs related to the topics that I learned in my second semester.
* Additionally, I have created another folder that contains some Python programs that I solved for problems that I solved online.

## Running the Programs
These programs have been tested on Linux

To run a python program, navigate to the folder containing the program and run the following command:
```
python programname.py
```
