# Python Programs for SECOND Semester
This repository contains the Python programs that I have submitted for assignments and records during my second semester at college. The programs cover a range of topics, including basic data types, control structures, arrays, functions, and file handling.

## Structure of the Repository
The repository is organized into separate folders for each topic. Each folder contains multiple Python programs related to the topic. Additionally, there is a separate folder for lab assignments and records.

These programs have been tested on Linux

To c a run gram, navigate to the folder containing the program and run the following command:
```

```
