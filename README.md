# Python Programs
This repository houses the Python programs that I have developed and submitted for assignments and records during my second semester at college. These programs encompass various topics, such as fundamental data types, control structures, lists, functions, and file manipulation. Moreover, I have included Python files that demonstrate my progress and learning throughout my programming journey.

## Running the Programs
These programs have been tested on both Linux and Windows operating systems.

To execute a Python program, navigate to the directory containing the script and run the following command:

```bash
python programname.py
```

The programs have been successfully tested using Visual Studio Code on Windows 11, but you are welcome to use any IDE of your choice.

## Contact
If you come across any mistakes in the programs or have any suggestions for improvement, please feel free to contact me <jaya2004kra@gmail.com>. I appreciate any feedback that can help me improve my coding skills
