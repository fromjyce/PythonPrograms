# Python Programs
This repository houses the Python programs that I have developed and submitted for assignments and records during my second semester at college. These programs encompass various topics, such as fundamental data types, control structures, lists, functions, and file manipulation. Moreover, I have included Python files that demonstrate my progress and learning throughout my programming journey.

## Running the Programs
These programs have been tested on Linux

To run a python program, navigate to the folder containing the program and run the following command:
```
python programname.py
```
